        ## About Job Stories and JTBD

        Job Stories and the Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) framework provide a way of thinking about products and features from the perspective of the tasks users are trying to accomplish. The goal is to focus on the job that needs to be done, rather than the specific solution used to do it.

        A Job To Be Done:

        1. Is solution-agnostic.
        2. Results in progress when completed.
        3. Is relatively stable across time.

        A Job To Be Done doesn't know what products or solutions have existed, currently exist, or might exist. It's just framing some area of life where your customer is at the center of a struggle, and they want some help solving the problem.

        For example:

        > ‚ÄúHelp me brush my teeth in the morning‚Äù is not a great example of a Job to Be Done statement.

        > ‚ÄúHelp me brush my teeth in the morning‚Äù is joined at the hip to an existing solution (a toothbrush) and there's only so far you'll be able to expand your thinking within that bubble.

        A better example of a Job to Be Done statement is:

        > ‚ÄúKeep my teeth healthy.‚Äù

        This statement is detached from a specific solution (a toothbrush) and moves toward the person's true motivation
