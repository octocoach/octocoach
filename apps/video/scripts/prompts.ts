AI Web Application Development

AI models like GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Llama are becoming standard tools — widely available and easily accessible. The real value, however, comes from developers who know how to steer these models, ground them in real-world data, and seamlessly integrate them into user interfaces.

In this 16-week course, you’ll learn to compose AI-driven user experiences from end to end. Using Next.js, you’ll integrate server-side logic and front-end interactivity seamlessly, enabling real-time data streaming and AI-powered features. TypeScript will help you write scalable, error-free code, while Postgres and pgvector allow you to ground AI models with real-world data for applications like search or recall-augmented generation.

You’ll deploy everything smoothly using Docker, and manage your codebase with Git and GitHub for efficient collaboration. Push your creativity further with Fal.AI for image generation and ElevenLabs for voice, adding new layers of interactivity to your applications.

Curriculum
This course isn’t about passive learning or sitting through endless lectures. It’s about learning the skills that make you valuable in today’s world — steering AI models, grounding them with real-world data, and composing them into dynamic user experiences. Over 16 weeks, you’ll go through two phases of hands-on learning, where you build real projects that prepare you to solve real problems.

Learning Phases
Weeks 1 - 12: Individual Projects
In the first 12 weeks, you’ll complete four projects that guide you from mastering the basics of AI integration to tackling complex, multi-layered applications. These aren’t just exercises — they are real-world problems designed to teach you how to make AI models work for business needs, how to handle data, and how to build user interfaces that seamlessly integrate AI. Each project builds on the previous one, growing in complexity and depth, helping you reinforce key skills like responsive design, real-time data streaming, authentication, and data persistence — all while integrating advanced AI features.

Weeks 13 - 16: Open-Source Project
In the final 4 weeks, you'll join your peers to work on a real open-source project. This is where all your learning comes together. You’ll experience what it’s like to work in a professional development team — collaborating on code, using version control, managing CI/CD pipelines, and applying Agile methodologies. You’ll also face real-world challenges like integrating multiple AI models and solving problems in a live environment. It’s the ultimate preparation for the teamwork and problem-solving you’ll need in the industry, and it positions you to create the kind of value that businesses are searching for.

Integrating AI Models in Web Applications

Learn to seamlessly integrate AI into your web applications. You'll start by generating content like text, images, and audio using powerful AI models. As you progress, you'll master working with Large Language Models and other advanced tools, equipping you to transform your applications with cutting-edge AI technology. This isn't just about theory—every concept you learn will be directly applied in the projects you work on, giving you the practical skills needed to build intelligent, responsive web applications.

Building Scalable Full-Stack Web Applications

It’s not just about AI—your app needs a solid foundation. You’ll dive into the latest web technologies like TypeScript and Next.js to build scalable, maintainable applications. Learn how to create robust client-server architectures with server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes. You’ll also get hands-on with state management and server actions, ensuring your applications are as efficient as they are powerful.

Chaining and Integrating AI Models for Intelligent Applications

Good AI developers know that it’s not just about using a single model. It’s about combining them to get the best results. You’ll learn to chain AI models together—think of models writing prompts for other models—to perform complex, multi-step tasks. From text generation and image creation to speech processing, you’ll discover how to integrate models from different providers, optimizing performance and cost. As AI features mature, this skill will set you apart, allowing you to build more efficient, intelligent applications.
