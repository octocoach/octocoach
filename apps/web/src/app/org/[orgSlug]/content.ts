    question: `What are the prerequisites for joining? I don't have any previous knowledge of programming, can I still join?`,
    answer: `The Q15 coaching program is tailored for individuals who already have a foundational understanding of web development. Participants should be proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, capable of creating basic websites and small applications. Our program is an excellent fit for those who may have completed a 3-month bootcamp or an online curriculum like freeCodeCamp.

  In addition to these technical prerequisites, a conversational level of proficiency in both English and German is required. English is the predominant language in the global tech industry, used for coding, documentation, and international communication. Being proficient in English opens doors to a wealth of resources, communities, and opportunities in the tech world. Likewise, a conversational level of German will facilitate communication within the local job market and with potential German-speaking employers.
  
  For those without prior programming knowledge, we recommend initially undertaking a bootcamp or an online course to establish a solid foundation in web development. Likewise, if you need to improve your language skills, enrolling in a language course or utilizing language learning apps like Duolingo or Babbel for English and German proficiency can be beneficial. Once you've acquired the basic technical and language skills, Q15 is here to refine those skills, bridge any remaining gaps, and guide you towards securing a fulfilling position in the tech industry.`,

    question: `How will my interests and skills be assessed in the "Discover" phase?`,
    answer: `At Q15, we strive for a realistic assessment aligned with the actual job market. We daily collect job descriptions from job posting sites and utilize AI to extract specific tasks or duties each job entails.

These duties are matched with our skills database, and turned into questions gauging your interest. You simply answer these questions with 'yes', 'no' or 'maybe'. Once you express interest in a duty, you'll be asked to self-assess your skill level for the required skills that duty entails.

This method provides a good indication of the jobs you're interested in and how your self-assessed skill levels relate to them. It's our starting point. To ensure accuracy, we perform a sanity check through one or two trial tasks, adjusting your self-assessed score as needed, providing a more accurate reflection of your skills and interests.`,

    question: `How are the coaching sessions conducted? Are they in-person, online, or a mix of both?`,
    answer: `The coaching sessions at Q15 are primarily conducted online, offering the convenience and flexibility to engage from anywhere, which can be particularly beneficial for those with tight schedules or geographical constraints. However, we highly value the personalized experience and rapport that in-person interactions can foster. Hence, we do offer the possibility of in-person sessions depending on preference and feasibility.

We are situated in Düsseldorf and utilize the Factory Campus space for our in-person meetings. Where possible, we prefer to meet coachees in person at least once as coaching is a personal endeavor, and online sessions often become more effective once a personal connection has been established.

Both in-person and online coaching sessions have their merits. The effectiveness of either mode can vary based on individual preferences, the nature of the coaching, and the skills of the coach in delivering via each mode. Our flexible approach aims to cater to different preferences and situations, ensuring a conducive and effective coaching environment for every participant.`,
  },
  {
    question: `Is there a particular tech stack, language or industry that Q15 specializes in?`,

It’s a great way to get a firsthand account of the Q15 experience and to network with individuals who have navigated the same path you’re embarking on.`,
  },
  {
    question: `What language will be coaching be done in?`,
    answer: `The primary language for coaching at Q15 is English, as it is the predominant language used in the tech industry globally. Being adept in English is crucial not only for job interviews but also for working on open-source projects, where communication is predominantly carried out in English. Moreover, programming languages themselves, including JavaScript, utilize English keywords.
    
While I am fluent in German and can provide clarification or explanations in German when necessary, the coaching sessions are conducted in English to better prepare you for the linguistic demands of the tech industry. By immersing in an English-speaking coaching environment, you're also honing your technical communication skills in English, which will be invaluable in your tech career.`,
