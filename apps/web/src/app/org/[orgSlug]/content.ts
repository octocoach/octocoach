export const coach = `Adriaan's journey into the digital world commenced at a tender age with a Pong machine, which was a prelude to a lifelong kinship with technology. The subsequent arrival of a Sinclair ZX Spectrum further fueled his curiosity, but it was the IBM Clone running on DOS that truly ignited the flame. When he wasn't playing outside with his friends under the sunny Johannesburg skies, young Adriaan embarked on digital adventures, solving problems in MS Basic on a green monochrome screen during his elementary school years.

His fascination with computers evolved alongside the technology of the era, from the 286 to the 486, and eventually the Pentium. Adriaan's love for Sierra On-line adventure games and SimCity, which also inspired the aesthetics of this website, led him to dig deeper into the technical realm, enhancing his machine with salvaged RAM to run these games. This knack also spawned a small computer business during high school. Here, he delved into Turbo Pascal and explored C++, marking his initial foray into diverse programming languages.

Post high school, the allure of advancing his technical skills steered him towards an MCSD certification while working in IT support. A subsequent role at an ad agency not only honed his web design skills but also provided a valuable experience in design, working alongside great designers. His forays into SQL, Visual Basic and Delphi during this period laid a solid foundation for future endeavors. The MCSD certification, in particular, imparted a deep understanding of solution design, bridging the gap between code and its real-world applications, thereby cultivating an appreciation for the business side of technology.

Having not ventured beyond the African continent, Adriaan felt a compelling urge to explore the world before settling into a career. This led him to the UK, and later, to enriching stints as an ESL teacher in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and Seoul, Korea. In Korea, he ran his own private tutoring business, diving into PHP by creating Moodle extensions to streamline operations. These adventures were more than mere escapades; they broadened his understanding of diverse cultures and global perspectives, enriching his approach towards technology and education.

Returning to South Africa to complete his B.Ed, which he had begun remotely, and spurred by the enthusiasm of the 2010 World Cup, Adriaan's entrepreneurial spirit thrived with two business ventures. However, with a young child, the desire for a safer environment led him to the International School of DÃ¼sseldorf. As a Technology Integration Coach there, Adriaan didn't just teach; he innovated, leveraging Python and PHP to create tools that streamlined educational processes, one of which evolved into the SaaS App, Drive Companion. During his tenure at ISD, he also accomplished an M.Ed, further deepening his understanding of educational paradigms.

Since this story started in the 80s and for the sake of brevity, we'll make use of the trusty 80s style movie montage for the next part.

**BEGIN MONTAGE:**

_ðŸŽµ 80s synthesizer music starts playing ðŸŽµ_

- Montage begins with Adriaan teaching a bootcamp, with great enthusiasm.
- A grueling job application process, lost of interviews, trial tasks and trial days.
- Transition to an EdTech startup, he's coding a new feature.
- Late-night coding sessions, screen glow illuminating his determination.
- Adriaan, brainstorming with a team.
- His expertise morphing from PHP to JavaScript, then TypeScript.
- He is interviewing a candidate for a job.
- Coffee cups pile up as the features roll out.
- Another job application process, lost of interviews, trial tasks and trial days.
- Transition to a job offer from a web agency.
- Record scratch; Music stops, freeze frame, Adriaan looks confused.
- The web agency which hired him, lays him off before he even starts, citing financial difficulties.
- A lightbulb moment, Adriaan has an idea.

**END MONTAGE:**

In the wake of navigating grueling job applications, Adriaan yearned for a mentor to ease the process, not a recruiter seeking a paycheck, but someone in his corner. Although job offers weren't scarce, the uncertainty of making the right choice prevailed. Through each interview, trial task, and offer declined, he amassed a reservoir of insights not just into the tech recruitment process but the art of making informed career decisions. This nuanced understanding seeded the vision for Q15, epitomized by the tagline "Debug your Career." Q15 emerged as a conduit for developers to not just navigate the tech industry but to understand and articulate their value, steering their career with informed, strategic choices.`;

    answer: `The Q15 coaching program is tailored for individuals who already have a foundational understanding of web development. Participants should be proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, capable of creating basic websites and small applications. Our program is an excellent fit for those who may have completed a 3-month bootcamp or an online curriculum like freeCodeCamp.

  In addition to these technical prerequisites, a conversational level of proficiency in both English and German is required. English is the predominant language in the global tech industry, used for coding, documentation, and international communication. Being proficient in English opens doors to a wealth of resources, communities, and opportunities in the tech world. Likewise, a conversational level of German will facilitate communication within the local job market and with potential German-speaking employers.
  
  For those without prior programming knowledge, we recommend initially undertaking a bootcamp or an online course to establish a solid foundation in web development. Likewise, if you need to improve your language skills, enrolling in a language course or utilizing language learning apps like Duolingo or Babbel for English and German proficiency can be beneficial. Once you've acquired the basic technical and language skills, Q15 is here to refine those skills, bridge any remaining gaps, and guide you towards securing a fulfilling position in the tech industry.`,

    question: `How will my interests and skills be assessed in the "Discover" phase?`,
    answer: `At Q15, we strive for a realistic assessment aligned with the actual job market. We daily collect job descriptions from job posting sites and utilize AI to extract specific tasks or duties each job entails.

These duties are matched with our skills database, and turned into questions gauging your interest. You simply answer these questions with 'yes', 'no' or 'maybe'. Once you express interest in a duty, you'll be asked to self-assess your skill level for the required skills that duty entails.

This method provides a good indication of the jobs you're interested in and how your self-assessed skill levels relate to them. It's our starting point. To ensure accuracy, we perform a sanity check through one or two trial tasks, adjusting your self-assessed score as needed, providing a more accurate reflection of your skills and interests.`,
